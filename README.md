How to Check Your Walmart Gift Card Balance: A Step-by-Step Guide

Walmart gift cards are one of the most popular payment options for shoppers, offering the flexibility to shop both online and in-store. Whether you’ve received a gift card for a special occasion or you’ve simply chosen to load one up with funds for personal use, keeping track of your balance is essential. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to check your Walmart gift card balance quickly and easily so you can start shopping without any surprises at checkout.

Why Check Your Walmart Gift Card Balance?

Before diving into the process, it's important to understand why checking your balance is crucial. Walmart gift cards don’t come with an expiration date (except where prohibited by law), but you do want to ensure you’re fully aware of your remaining balance before making a purchase. Running out of funds in the middle of a transaction can be inconvenient, and knowing your balance ahead of time helps you plan your shopping trips better.

If you're looking to check your balance, you're in the right place. Keep reading to find out how to do it!

After navigating to the balance page, you’ll be prompted to enter your Walmart gift card number (a 16-digit number on the front of the card) and the PIN (a 4-digit code located on the back of the card). This information is necessary to verify that you are the rightful owner of the card and to retrieve its balance.

Plus, by having an account, you can track your purchase history, check your balance at any time, and even reload your gift card directly from Walmart.com.

Step 5: Start Shopping!
